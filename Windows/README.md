# dotfiles for Windows
For Windows, I prepare mac.ahk and setting.json for Windows Terminal.

# mac.ahk
To install the mac.ahk, first you should install AutoHotKey.
I recommend to install AutoHotKey by using Chocolatey.
Then, you should compile mac.ahk using Ahk2Exe which includes AutoHotKey.
And also I recommend to use [alt-ime-ahk](https://github.com/karakaram/alt-ime-ahk).

# settings.json
Settings for Windows Terminal.
To use it, you should copy the file to the following location:
`C:/Users/<user>/AppData/Local/Packages/Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_<randomString>/LocalState`
